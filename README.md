# Physics
A number of different physics and math simulations using my 3D engine


Physics

Solar: a simulation of celestial bodies using Newton's laws of gravity.
Fluods: a simple simuation of basic fluid dynamics
Double Pendulum: a simulation demonstrating the chaotic nature of double pendulums.

Math
Marching Cubes: an implementation of the marching cubes algorithm.
Marching Squares: an implementation of the marching squares algorithm.
Fractals: a drawer for different fractals, including the Sierpinski triangle, fractal tree, and Mandelbrot set.
